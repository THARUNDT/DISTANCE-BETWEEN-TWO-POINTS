# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Get the four coordinate values from the user

### Step 2: 
Use import.math to assign the distance formula

### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Round the value up to two decimal values and the print values it would be calculated

### Step 5: 
End the program

### PROGRAM:
# Program to find the distance between two points.

import math
x1=4
x2=10
y1=2
y2=6
distance=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print(round(distance,2))
~~~


### OUTPUT:
